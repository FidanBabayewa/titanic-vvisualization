# Titanic Data Visualization with Seaborn

This project involves visualizing the Titanic dataset using the Seaborn library in Python. The dataset contains information about passengers on the Titanic, and we will specifically analyze passengers by their age and class, utilizing Seaborn plots such as `countplot`, `heatmap`, `FacetGrid`, and `distplot`.



## Introduction

The goal of this project is to explore and visualize insights from the Titanic dataset. We will be using the Seaborn library to create informative and visually appealing plots that help us understand the relationship between passengers' age, class, and various other factors.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the famous "Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster" dataset. It contains information about passengers on the Titanic, including details such as age, class, sex, and survival status. The dataset is publicly available and can be accessed through various sources, such as [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data).

## Results

The visualization notebook includes the following Seaborn plots :

- `countplot` showing the distribution of passengers' classes.
- `heatmap` illustrating the correlation between age, class, and other features.
- `FacetGrid` plots to compare age distributions across different classes.
- `distplot` to visualize the age distribution of passengers.

The visualizations aim to provide insights into how age and class influenced passengers' experiences on the Titanic.
